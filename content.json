Summary This article presents a conceptual framework for realising a CDT mostly based on a review of the existing literature. Outline current research landscape around the subject of BIM uses. Analysis of the DT paradigm from nearby engineering domains. List several DT abilities or features which would enable real-time, web integrated, intelligent CDTs. Background The complexity of BIM dimensions and domains. The IFC format was designed for teansferring model, not to be modified or used dynamically——The inclusion of Linked Data and Web Ontology Language models. The Digital Twin paradigm Related WorkReading SummarySome conceptions nD BIM: Change the meaning of ‘dimension’, more likely referring to application domains, uses or usecases of 3D and 4D modelling. Ontologies: A formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.","link":"/2022/09/09/1/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[],"pages":[]}
