Analyse the components and perceive abilities of Digital Twins as applied across a wide range of engineering domains; 3. Identify current gaps and directions for future research. Summary This article presents a conceptual framework for realizing a CDT mostly based on a review of the existing literature. Outline the current research landscape around the subject of BIM uses. Analysis of the DT paradigm from nearby engineering domains. List several DT abilities or features which would enable real-time, web-integrated, intelligent CDTs. Background The complexity of BIM dimensions and domains. The IFC format was designed for the transferring model, not to be modified or used dynamically——The inclusion of Linked Data and Web Ontology Language models. The Digital Twin paradigm Related WorkAnalysis of the research landscapeDistribution by publication date Provide a structured in-depth view of each identified BIM use during construction. Introduce each identified BIM use Technologies for managing semantics Industry foundation classes There is a low level of IFC adoption concerning nD modeling in general. generate construction sequences based on IFC objects at the task level. import IFC model data and generate a schedule based on materials and pre-defined algorithms. a more recent study outlines the features of a variety of tools supporting IFC and various commercial formats for cost analysis——unlikely to incorporate a 4-5D BIM model. Semantic web ontologies Semantic web and linked data facilitate interoperability between the large spectrums of application domains involved in the construction sector. Outlining the evolution of technologies and information models position the DT to be fully reliant on the IFC schema (in its various file formats), ensuring semantic-rich structured data, which would form the foundation for more efficient ontology-based tools and agents. the level of BIM development towards Digital Twins is still very low, with very few relying on IFC. Cross-domain Digital Twin uses The main challenge of using sensors with DT appears when dealing with the Spatio-temporal resolutions, demanding a successful integration of sensors of different capabilities, reading frequencies, accuracies, their respective locations, and the inter-dependencies between sensor clusters and networks. Identified Digital Twin abilities and their roles within the Virtual-Data-Physical paradigm Construction Digital Twin data usage for facilitating smart construction services Propose an evolutionary 3-tier level CDT paradigmOthers Some conceptions nD BIM: Change the meaning of ‘dimension’, more likely referring to application domains, uses, or use cases of 3D and 4D modeling. Ontologies: A formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.","link":"/2022/09/09/Paper-Reading-1-BIM-CDT/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Paper Reading","slug":"Paper-Reading","link":"/tags/Paper-Reading/"}],"categories":[],"pages":[]}
